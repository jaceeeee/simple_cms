Asset pipeline
	Benefits
		- concatenates CSS and JavaScript files
		- compresses and minifies CSS and JavaScript
		- precompiles CSS and JavaScript
		- Allows writing assets in other languages (Sass, CoffeeScript, ERB)
		- Adds asset fingerprinting

	Files in Public Directory
		They won't be found in the 'public' directory; instead, they'll be found in the 'app/assets' directory. 
		For example:
			app/assets/images
			app/assets/javascripts
			app/assets/stylesheets

		But if stuck in 'public', they'll lose the advantages above

	Manifest Files
		- contain directives for including asset files
		- Loaded, processed, concatenated, compressed
		- Serve one file, but develop with many files

	Development vs Production
		- Development
			- Skips concatenation
			- Skips compression
			- Skips fingerprinting
			- Does file processing
		- Production
			- Does not do any asset processing
			- Assumes that assets have been precompiled

	Development vs. Production
		- Precompilation	
			export RAILS_ENV=production
			bundle exec rails assets:precompile
