Secure Passwords

	Encrypting Passwords
		- Never store passwords in plain text
			Compromises users on your site
			Compromises users on other sites
	
	One-Way Encryption
		- One-way: nonreversible, even by us
		- Same inputs + same hashing algorithm = same output
		- Actual password encrypted and stored
		- Attempted password encrypted and compared
		- Rails uses Blowfish (encryption algorithm)
