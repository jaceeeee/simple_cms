Validates Method
	The following were methods previously
	validates_presence_of :email
	validates_length_of :email, :maximum => 50
	validates_uniqueness_of :email
	validates_format_of :email, :with => EMAIL_REGEX
	validates_confirmation_of :email

	A better wrapper method choice would be:
		# validates :email, :presence => true,
					:length => { :maximum => 50 },
					:uniqueness => true,
					:format => { :with => EMAIL_REGEX }
					:confirmation => true
