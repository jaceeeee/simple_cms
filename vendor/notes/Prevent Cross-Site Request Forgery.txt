Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery
	What is Cross-Site Request Forgery?
	- "CSRF" for short
	- Type of attack on a website
	- Exploits user's currently logged-in state to perform
	  actions which require authentication

	Prevent CSRF
		- Require user authentication
		- Regularly log out inactive users
		- GET requests should be read-only
		- Actions that expect POST requests should only respond to POST requests.
