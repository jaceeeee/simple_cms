Write Validations
	What to validate?
		- What are your data concerns?
			Decide what good and bad data look like
		- What restrictions does your database impose?
			Field types, field lengths, and null allowed
		- What would stop your application from working?

		- Review attributes of each model
		- Not: IDs, foreign keys, timestamps, booleans
